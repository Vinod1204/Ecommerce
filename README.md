# MERN Stack

## Introduction
Welcome to the README for the Online Shopping project built using the MERN Stack. This is not a real e-commerce website but rather an educational project for learning and practicing technologies and skills related to the MERN Stack.

## MERN Stack Overview
A free and open-source JavaScript software stack for creating dynamic websites and web applications

M: The typical NoSQL database is MongoDB.
E: The standard web application framework for creating RESTful APIs is Express.js.
R: The JavaScript library React.js, which is used to create user interface elements.
N: Node.js is an open-source server environment that runs on multiple operating systems, including Windows, Linux, Unix, and macOS.
These technologies work together to create single-page web apps that are quickly loaded, perform well, and provide seamless user experiences.
Windows, Linux, Unix, macOS, and more...


## Project Objectives

The Online Shopping project's primary goal is to provide a web application that enables users to browse product lists, add items to their carts, and experience a virtual checkout procedure. We will practice and obtain a greater comprehension of the following through this project:

- Constructing a MongoDB database to hold orders and product data.
- Building APIs for database interaction with Express.js.
React is used to create interactive user interfaces.
- Taking care of account administration, login, and user registration.
- Including payment and shopping cart features.


The following directories are present in the project directory:

- **client-admin**: This directory contains the React.js-built client-side source code for the admin interface.
- **client-customer**: This includes the React.js-built client interface's client-side source code.
- **resources**: Has a range of resources for the project.
    - ***images***: Contains project-related images.
    JSON files included in the ***mongodb*** folder can be loaded into a MongoDB database.
    - ***postman***: This package houses Postman's API collection, which makes API documentation and testing easier.
- **server**: Contains the Node.js and Express.js server-side source code.


## How to Use

You can explore the product list, add items to your basket, register, log in, and practice the checkout procedure once you've accessed the website. Logging in to the admin page will allow you to manage orders, categories, goods, and customer accounts.

## Principal Technology

**Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB 
**Package and Tool Management**: npm, Git
**Front-end**: React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
